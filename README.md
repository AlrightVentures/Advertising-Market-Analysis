# Advertising-Market-Analysis
E-learning companies offer courses on programming, e.g. web and mobile development, data science, game development, etc. They want to promote their products to reach new customers.

My goal in this project is to find out two best markets (countries) for e-learning course advertising.

I try to make use of existing data to determine whether I can reach any reliable result.

One good candidate is freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of this analysis.

The survey data is publicly available in their GitHub repository.
